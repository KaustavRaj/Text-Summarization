# Text Summarizer
---
Here I have implemented a _text summarizer_ based on **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset, which is kept in **/data** section as "_Reviews.csv_" and can also be found on kaggle.
The **Text Summarization** jupyter notebook contains the entire code of how I implemented the abstractive text summarizer model.

Further more, a manual bearing the name **Text Summarization Manual** is also given for using the trained model easily.
